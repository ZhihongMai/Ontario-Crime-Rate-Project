# ðŸ“‚ **Ontario Crime Rate Project**

## ðŸ“š *Introduction*
In this project, I used Python for data cleaning and categorized family, education, population, and economic factors into high, medium, and low levels. I also merged the data and saved it in Excel format for Tableau visualization. The goal was to analyze which factors influence crime rates and whether these factors have a greater impact on YCJA cases. Additionally, I examined whether case types and trial processes affect conviction rates.
